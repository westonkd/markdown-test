3.  Heading Two

While seeking a Computer Science internship for spring 2015 two
co-workers pointed me to Instructure. One of these co-workers, Matthew
Sessions, was recently hired by Instructure and begins work next year.
Technology and education are two of my passions; therefore I am
naturally excited to apply for this position. I am currently a studying
Computer Science at Brigham Young University-Idaho and work as the lead
ASP.NET MVC View developer for the university. My solid foundation in
Computer Science coupled my experience in back/front-end web development
make me an candidate for an internship opportunity.
